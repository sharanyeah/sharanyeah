        intro: 'One topic a day explorations',
        content: `The Curiosity Project started as a simple challenge: learn something completely new every single day and document it. Not the shallow "fun fact" kind of learning, but deep dives into topics I'd normally scroll past.

Some days it's quantum computing. Other days it's the economics of maple syrup production. The goal isn't to become an expert—it's to stay perpetually curious and uncomfortable.

I've learned that the best ideas come from connecting seemingly unrelated dots. When you force yourself to learn about 19th-century textile patterns and modern machine learning in the same week, weird creative things happen.

The archive contains over 200 explorations so far. Each one taught me that the world is infinitely more interesting than my small corner of it suggests.`

        intro: 'React component library',
        content: `After using a dozen different UI libraries, I got tired of fighting with overcomplicated components that tried to do everything. So I built my own—aggressively minimal, opinionated, and composable.

The philosophy is simple: give developers the primitives, not the kitchen sink. A button should be a button. If you want it to do backflips, compose it yourself.

Built with TypeScript, fully accessible (ARIA compliant), and intentionally limited in scope. It has exactly 12 components. That's it. Everything else is composition.

Used in production by a few startups who were also tired of importing 400KB of dependencies to render a dropdown.`

        intro: 'LLM-powered writing tool',
        content: `Most AI writing tools try to write for you. This one helps you write better by being an intelligent editing partner.

It analyzes your drafts and suggests improvements: tighter sentences, clearer structure, stronger arguments. But it never replaces your voice—it amplifies it.

The secret sauce is in the prompting. Instead of generic "make this better" commands, it asks pointed questions: "What's the one thing you want the reader to remember?" or "Can you cut this paragraph without losing meaning?"

Built using GPT-4 with custom fine-tuning on thousands of editing sessions. Used by writers, founders, and students who want to improve, not outsource.`

        title: 'On productivity systems',
        preview: 'Why they all fail eventually',
        content: `Every productivity system eventually fails. I've tried them all: GTD, bullet journaling, Notion templates, time blocking, the Pomodoro technique. They work brilliantly... for about three weeks.

Then life happens. A crisis emerges. Your perfectly organized system becomes just another source of guilt as tasks pile up unchecked.

The problem isn't the system—it's the fantasy that the right method will make you permanently organized. Productivity isn't a state you achieve; it's a muscle you exercise inconsistently.

My new approach: assume the system will break. Build for resilience, not perfection. Keep it simple enough that restarting takes minutes, not hours.

The best productivity system is the one you'll actually restart after you inevitably abandon it.`

        title: 'Coffee shop observations',
        preview: 'People-watching thoughts',
        content: `I'm writing this from my favorite coffee shop, where I've spent approximately 400 hours over the past year. I know this because they have a loyalty card system and I've done the math.

The same people come at the same times. The guy with the MacBook covered in startup stickers arrives at 9 AM sharp. The grad student with the highlighter collection shows up at 2 PM. The couple that argues in whispers sits by the window every Thursday.

We're all here for the same reason: the illusion of productivity. There's something about paying $5 for mediocre coffee that makes you feel obligated to actually work.

Home is too comfortable. Libraries are too quiet. Coffee shops hit the sweet spot—just enough ambient noise to drown out your thoughts, just enough people-watching to justify procrastination breaks.

I've written three major projects here. The coffee is terrible, but the vibes are immaculate.`

        title: 'Digital minimalism',
        preview: 'Less apps, more peace',
        content: `I deleted 47 apps from my phone last month. Not because I'm a tech ascetic—I just realized I was spending mental energy on things that didn't matter.

The paradox of choice applies to software. Every app is a tiny decision: should I check this? Update that? Respond here? By noon I'd made 100 micro-decisions that left me exhausted.

Digital minimalism isn't about using less technology. It's about being intentional. Keep the tools that genuinely improve your life. Delete everything else, no matter how "useful" it might be someday.

My phone now has 23 apps. I know exactly why each one is there. The mental clarity is worth more than the convenience of having every possible tool at my fingertips.

Less isn't always more. But in the case of apps, it absolutely is.`
